Complete 'load_case.py' with below requirement:

1. The output should be generate a new dict structure as following
2. PLEASE NOTE:
    - GPU number is integer from 1 to 8, your code should ignore other invalid scenario.
    - In original case structure, those commands have some redundant space, your code should format them to single space.

Notes:
a. The main part has been completed, you need implement the main functions: load_case_by_gpu().
b. Refer to the function docstrings in the source file.

Example:
Run: python load_case.py
In orig_cases dict structure, you will find valid GPU number '3', '4' by '-gpu 3', '-gpu 4', so it will be transferred to new dict format:
{
  "3": [
    {"exe": "test_bin -a -b -gpu 3 -d -e", "timeout": 10},
    {"exe": "test_bin -b -gpu 3 -d -e", "timeout": 20}
  ],
  "4": [
    {"exe": "test_bin -a -c -gpu 4 -d", "timeout": 30}
  ]
}
